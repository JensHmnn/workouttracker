# Workout Tracker

This project's goal is to create an app for tracking workouts and utilizing this data to be able to gain various insights. It's still in an early stage. In the future I will add more variety to the types of workouts and the displayable charts. Also I will make the automatic calculation of burned calories more accurate by adding workout intensity.　The file "workout.db" contains a SQL database of randomly generated workout data. The code I used to create this database can be found in the "generate_db.py" file.

このプロジェクトの目的は、ジムでの運動を記録するアプリを作成し、そのデータを活用してさまざまな分析や洞察を得られるようにすることです。現在はまだ初期段階にあります。将来的には、選択できる運動の種類と、データを視覚化できるグラフを増やす予定です。また、運動強度などを加味することで、自動的に算出される消費カロリーの精度を高めていきます。「workout.db」はランダムに生成された運動トデータのSQLデータベースです。このデータベースを作成するために使用したコードは「generate_db.py」ファイルにあります。

One the left side of the app you can use the different entry fields to add your own workouts to the database./
If you don't fill in your own calculated "calories" value for the calories you burned, the app will calculate the burned calories automatically./
The "description" field is also optional and can be used to add comments or other remarks./

The data that has been added to the workout database before can be seen in the table on the bottom right./
The data which is already in the databse was randomly generated by using the "generate_db.py" script./

You can also delete workouts from the database by clicking on one of the entries and then clicking "delete"./
Then a textbox will appear, asking if you are certain that you want to delete this workout./
If you want to delete the workout, click "Yes"./

Ticking the "darkmode", will turn on the darkmode./

On the bottom left, you can use the dropdown to select a chart type./
This allows you to gain deeper insights into your past workout data./

The first chart is a scatterplot that allows to see how many calories were burned depending on how long the workout was./

The second chart is also a scatterplot that I misused in order to create a workout schedule that shows on which days the person worked out as well as the type of the workout (color)./

The third chart is a stacked bar chart which shows how much time was spent on workouts each month./
Also, the coloring of the bars reveals how much of that monthly workout time was spent on the different types of workouts./
